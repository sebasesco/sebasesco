Hi there! I'm **Sebastian Escobar**, a full-stack developer with a passion for building scalable, user-focused web applications. I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at Georgia Tech, specializing in Machine Learning.

I love building full-stack apps, tackling algorithmic challenges, and diving into data.

On a mission to bridge software engineering with intelligent systems — and have fun while doing it.
